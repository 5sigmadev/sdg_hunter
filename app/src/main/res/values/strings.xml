    <string name="about_text_val">Developed by a team of students during the “ODD Summer 2016” summer school, “SDG Hunter” is a game that proposes a fun and engaging way to make people aware of the existence of the SDGs.\n
    In the game, issues related to the different Goals (poverty, hunger, ...) are depicted as augmented reality SDG Monsters, that the player has to place in the environment every time he/she sees an instance of that issue.
    For example, you see a huge traffic jam in a street and you create a “Goal 11” SDG Monster for sustainable transport systems at that place.\n
    Taking a “selfie” with the SDG Monster in that location, and posting it on social media, will raise awareness of the SDGs and at the same time will build a crowdsourced global map of sustainable development issues.\n
